================================================================================

CONFIG_SSDFS_DEBUG
	  This option enables additional pre-condition and post-condition
	  checking in functions. The main goal of this option is providing
	  environment for debugging code in SSDFS driver and excluding
	  debug checking from end-users' kernel build. This option enables
	  debug output by means of pr_debug() from all files too. You can
	  disable debug output from any file via the 'dynamic_debug/control'
	  file. Please, see Documentation/dynamic-debug-howto.txt for
	  additional information.

CONFIG_SSDFS_TRACK_API_CALL
	  This option enables output from the key subsystems' fucntions.
	  The main goal of this option is providing the vision of
	  file system activity.

CONFIG_SSDFS_MEMORY_LEAKS_ACCOUNTING
	  This option enables accounting of memory allocation
	  (kmalloc, kzalloc, kcalloc, kmem_cache_alloc, alloc_page)
	  by means of incrementing a global counters and deallocation
	  (kfree, kmem_cache_free, free_page) by means decrementing
	  the same global counters. Also, there are special global counters
	  that tracking the number of locked/unlocked memory pages.
	  However, global counters have an unpleasant side effect.
	  If there are several mounted SSDFS partitions in the system
	  then memory leaks accounting subsystem is miscalculating
	  the number of memory leaks and triggers false alarms.
	  It makes sense to use the memory leaks accounting subsystem
	  only for single mounted SSDFS partition in the system.

CONFIG_SSDFS_BTREE_CONSISTENCY_CHECK
	  This option enables checking the btree consistency.

CONFIG_SSDFS_BTREE_STRICT_CONSISTENCY_CHECK
	  This option enables checking the btree consistency
	  after every btree's operation. This option could
	  seriously degrades the file system performance.

CONFIG_SSDFS_TESTING
	  This option enables testing infrastructure of SSDFS
	  filesystem.

CONFIG_SSDFS_UNDER_DEVELOPMENT_FUNC
	  This option enables functionality that is under
	  development yet.

CONFIG_SSDFS_POSIX_ACL
	  This option enables POSIX Access Control Lists support.
	  POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) support permissions for users and
	  groups beyond the owner/group/world scheme.
	  To learn more about Access Control Lists, visit the POSIX ACLs for
	  Linux website <http://acl.bestbits.at/>.

CONFIG_SSDFS_ZLIB
	  This option enables ZLIB compression support.
	  Zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered,
	  lossless data-compression library for use on virtually any computer
	  hardware and operating system. It offers a good trade-off between
	  compression achieved and the amount of CPU time and memory necessary
	  to compress and decompress. See <http://www.gzip.org/zlib/> for
	  further information.

CONFIG_SSDFS_LZO
	  This option enables LZO compression support.
	  The minilzo-based compression. Generally works better than Zlib.
	  LZO compression is mainly aimed at embedded systems with slower
	  CPUs where the overheads of zlib are too high.
