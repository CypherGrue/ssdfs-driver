                       [*** SEGMENT ARCHITECTURE ***]

SSDFS file system volume is aggregation of segments. Each segment contains one
or several PEBs (Physical Erase Block). File system's metadata and user data
are stored in partial logs of segment.

Partial logs of segment are written in stripped manner into different PEBs.
For example, we have 4 PEBs in segment. Then, it is possible
to distribute partial logs of segment in likewise way:

PEB#0: log#0, log#4, log#8, log#12
PEB#1: log#1, log#5, log#9, log#13
PEB#2: log#2, log#6, log#10, log#14
PEB#3: log#3, log#7, log#11, log#15

As a result, if we have PEBs on different dies then
parallel flush threads will work efficiently during flushing
sequential segment's partial logs in parallel.

Every PEB object has several threads (read, flush and GC threads).
We need in flush thread only for newly allocated segment.
When we read some segment in "using" state from the volume then
it needs to start read and flush threads. It needs
to start read, flush and GC threads for segments in "used" and
"pre-dirty" states. The flush thread will be used for blocks
update activity, the GC thread will be used for migration of
valid blocks. And, finally, we need to start GC thread only for
segments in "dirty" states.
